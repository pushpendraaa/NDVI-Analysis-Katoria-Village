# NDVI Analysis Katoria
The project aims to turn wasteland into green land in a village located in Katoria using time series analysis of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) using GEE (Google Earth Engine). The project aims to address the problem of land degradation and desertification in the area due to unsustainable land use practices, deforestation, and climate change. These factors have resulted in the degradation of the ecosystem services and the loss of livelihoods for the local communities.
The solution proposed is to use remote sensing technology and time series analysis of NDVI to monitor vegetation dynamics and to identify the areas with the potential to regenerate and restore vegetation cover. The analysis will be conducted using GEE, a cloud-based platform that allows for the analysis of large volumes of satellite imagery and geospatial data.

The NDVI is a commonly used remote sensing index that quantifies the vegetation greenness and health based on the reflectance of the red and near-infrared wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. NDVI values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating healthier vegetation cover. The time series analysis of NDVI will be used to assess the changes in vegetation cover over time, identify trends and patterns, and to map the areas with potential for restoration.
The project will involve the following steps:
1. Data collection and preparation: The project will use Landsat satellite imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for the period from 1985 to the present. The images will be processed and prepared using GEE's cloud-based platform.

2. Time series analysis of NDVI: The NDVI values will be extracted from the Landsat imagery using GEE's algorithms, and the time series analysis of NDVI will be conducted to identify the areas with the potential for restoration and to assess the vegetation dynamics over time.

3. Mapping and visualization: The results of the analysis will be mapped and visualized using GEE's interactive mapping tools to identify the areas with the highest potential for restoration and to communicate the results to the local communities and stakeholders.

The project will provide valuable information to support the restoration of vegetation cover in the area, which will contribute to the conservation of ecosystem services, improve the livelihoods of local communities, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The project will also demonstrate the potential of remote sensing technology and cloud-based platforms such as GEE to support sustainable land management practices and environmental conservation efforts.

In conclusion, the use of time series analysis of NDVI using GEE is a promising approach to address the problem of land degradation and desertification in the area and to promote the restoration of vegetation cover. The project will provide valuable insights into the potential for sustainable land management practices and contribute to the conservation of the environment and the improvement of local livelihoods.

1.   **May:** This is the time for land preparation, such as plowing, harrowing, leveling, and bunding.
2.   **June:** Rice seeds are sown during this month. Farmers usually start with early-maturing varieties in lowland areas and then move on to the main crop.
3.   **July:** This month is critical for the growth of rice plants, as it is the time when monsoon rains arrive in most parts of India. Farmers need to ensure that the fields are adequately flooded and the young plants are not submerged.
4.   **August:** The rice plants start to tiller (produce side shoots) during this month, which helps to increase the number of panicles (flower clusters) and eventually the number of grains per panicle.
5.   **September:** This is the month when the rice plants start to flower. Farmers need to be vigilant to prevent damage from pests and diseases.
6.   **October:** The rice plants start to form grains during this month. Farmers need to ensure that the fields are kept flooded and that there is enough sunlight for the grains to mature.
7.   **November:** This is the month when the rice plants start to mature, and the grains start to turn yellow. Farmers need to monitor the fields and start preparing for harvest.
8.   **December:** This is the time for harvesting the rice crop. Farmers usually harvest the crop manually or with the help of machines. Once the rice is harvested, it is dried, threshed, and stored for later use.
9.   **January:** After the harvest, farmers usually prepare the fields for the next crop by plowing, harrowing, and applying fertilizers
